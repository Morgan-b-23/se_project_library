              At this event, which celebrates the library's namesake, our guest
              lecturer will take us on a journey exploring some of the most
              prominent female researchers in the world of space science. It's
              easy to buy into the misconception that this field was mostly
              dominated by men, but our lecture aims to change that notion and
              prove that this hasn't been the case since at least the 18th
              century.

                <p class="card__text">
                  This is one of the books that I constantly come back to. Its
                  plot is about a young boy named Ender Wiggins who's sent to a
                  military force academy in space to train as an elite officer.
                  We follow along the story of how he overcomes obstacles and
                  eventually find his true place in the academy. It's a classic
                  for a reason and a short read. So if you like sci-fi and a bit
                  of a coming-of-age story with a nice twist at the end I would
                  recommend.

                <p class="card__text">
                  This is more of a self-help book that talks about a fiance
                  through a collection of parables. I picked it up while wanting
                  to learn how to make make money work for you, not the other
                  way around. It's another short read and gives good advice on
                  how to be responsible with your finances through rich and
                  interesting stories.

                  This is another classic, for good reason, That follows the
                  story of Dr. Frankenstien and the hollowing downward spiral of
                  his life after his curiosity and obsession get the best of
                  him. This book is more of a horror fiction novel that I would
                  also suggest to read it if you haven't already. It's a very
                  captivating and emotionally moving story that will have you
                  coming back for a second read.

                <p class="card__text">
                  Burial Rites is a historical fiction novel based on a true
                  story. It follows the story of Agnes who has been sentenced to
                  death for murder. We go through her past and the events
                  leading up to the "murder" that ultimately would make her a
                  part of the last public execution of a woman in Iceland. This
                  book has more of a dark mystery feel to it, and if you are
                  better with sad endings than I am this would be a great book
                  to pick up.

              Libraries are essential establishments in practically every city,
              and the Triple Peaks Library is no exception. It first opened its
              doors way back in 2018, right as our humble town began bidding
              welcome to its very first citizens!
            </p>
            <p class="about__paragraph">
              Since its initial opening, the library has seen nearly 342 monthly
              visitors. That's almost 50% of our population! So far, most
              citizens have enjoyed reading books and using our ample online
              resources.
